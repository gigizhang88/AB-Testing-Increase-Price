# AB-Testing-Increase-Price


Company XYZ sells a software for $39. Since revenue has been flat for some time, the VP of　Product has decided to run a test increasing the price. She hopes that this would increase　revenue. In the experiment, 66% of the users have seen the old price ($39), while a random　sample of 33% users a higher price ($59).

The test has been running for some time and the VP of Product is interested in understanding　how it went and whether it would make sense to increase the price for all the users.

Especially he asked you the following questions:

Should the company sell its software for $39 or $59?

The VP of Product is interested in having a holistic view into user behavior, especially　focusing on actionable insights that might increase conversion rate. What are your main　findings looking at the data?

The VP of Product feels that the test has been running for too long and he should　have been able to get statistically significant results in a shorter time. Do you agree with　her intuition? After how many days you would have stopped the test? 

The analysis includes the experiment time efficiency, feature pattern and contribution and get insight from the customer information.
